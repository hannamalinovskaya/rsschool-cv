My main goal is not to stop studying and improving myself through the whole life. Main priority is to provide me and my family with al nesessary sruff, that can be needed, stop depending on government or state of living. I have an ability of learning new material very fast, if hard-working person and some kind of perfektionist. 

My working experience. As for me, i've never been working as a developer befor, but i did in a lot of spheres, for example: aviation, service and kind of office work. i'm looking forward to smth that can make my brains work, as well as make me liquid to all surcumstances that can exist.

I'm new in developing sphere, so, i can only add that i know html and css, started working on JS, but have not much experience.

I've ended 2 web-courses, based on html and CSS.

I have 4th level of aviation english and a lot of experience of speking in natieve environment, thats why i can state that i have upper-intermediate level of english.
